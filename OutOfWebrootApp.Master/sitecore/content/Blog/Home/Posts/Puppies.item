Unethical puppy farming is to be targeted in a new government crackdown against unscrupulous breeders, including tight new restrictions for selling pups online.

Announcing the proposal, the prime minister said she understood the joy of bringing home a new puppy, but that pet owners needed to know that many had not had an ethical and healthy start in life.

The government plans legislation in the new year to tackle so-called battery dogs, born in large-scale commercial breeding establishments. Campaigners have uncovered farms where mothers are given just enough food and water to keep them breeding continuously, in filthy conditions and with no exercise.

Plans include tough new rules for licensed dog breeders, including showing puppies alongside their mother before a sale is made.
